[[Unlike some markup languages, Fountain takes every carriage return as intent. This allows the writer to control the spacing between paragraphs in Action elements, as seen in this classic example:]]

Murtaugh, springing hell bent for leather -- and folks, grab your hats ... because just then, a BELL COBRA HELICOPTER crests the edge of the bluff.

An explosion of sound...
As it rises like an avenging angel ...
Hovers, shattering the air with turbo-throb, sandblasting the hillside with a roto-wash of loose dirt, tables, chairs, everything that's not nailed down ...

Screaming, chaos, frenzy.
Three words that apply to this scene.
All of these lines are interpreted as Action, and the writer's single and double-space decisions would be preserved.

[[There are some unusual cases where this will fail. If you wrote something like this:]]

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

THE DEALER eyes the new player warily.

SCANNING THE AISLES...
Where is that pit boss?

No luck. He has no choice to deal the cards.
[[...Fountain would interpret SCANNING THE AISLES... as a Character name--due to the entire line being in uppercase--and therefore subsequently interpret Where is that pit boss? as Dialogue. To correct this, use a preceding ! to force the uppercase line to be Action:]]

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

THE DEALER eyes the new player warily.

!SCANNING THE AISLES...
Where is that pit boss?

No luck. He has no choice to deal the cards.
[[In this case, INT. CASINO - NIGHT is a Scene Heading, and all the other lines are interpreted as Action elements.]]

[[Dialogue is a bit easier. If you typed:]]

DEALER
Ten.
Four.
Dealer gets a seven.  Hit or stand sir?

MONKEY
Dude, I'm a monkey.
[[...Fountain will know that DEALER's dialogue should be one continuous formatted block with forced line breaks. However, if you want to do the unconventional thing of leaving white space in dialogue:]]

DEALER
Ten.
Four.
Dealer gets a seven.

Hit or stand sir?

MONKEY
Dude, I'm a monkey.
[[...You would need to type two spaces on your "blank" line so that Fountain knows that Hit or stand sir? is not an Action element:]]

DEALER
Ten.
Four.
Dealer gets a seven.
  
Hit or stand sir?

MONKEY
Dude, I'm a monkey.
