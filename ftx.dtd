<!-- My XML representation of the Fountain format  -->

<!-- FTX follows, as closely as it can, the structure implicit in a
     Fountain document, but with the structure and semantics explicit
     in the document. As a rule, character content in FTX represents
     visible text, such that if all tags disappeared and only element
     text remained, the screenplay would still read correctly, delta
     formatting. As such, sections headers, invisible in print per
     Fountain specification, are attributes on relevant elements, but
     character names are element text rather than attributes
     on <dialog>. Extensions ("V.O.", "O.S.") are attributes
     on <character>; this allows validating them with this DTD and
     simplifies direct CSS formatting of FTX. -->
