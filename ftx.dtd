<!-- My XML representation of the Fountain format  -->

<!-- FTX follows, as closely as it can, the structure implicit in a
     Fountain document, but with the structure and semantics explicit
     in the document. It furthers adheres to the rule that character
     content represents visible text, such that if all tags
     disappeared and only element text remained, the screenplay would
     still read correctly, delta formatting. As such, sections
     headers, invible in print per Fountain specification, are
     attributes on relevant elements, but extensions ("V.O.", "O.S.")
     are element text. -->
